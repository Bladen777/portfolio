    history:` 
        I have always had a massive respect for good design, design that inspires and captures interest.
        While attending Medicine Hat College I was able to sharpen these skills, and develope new ones in the process.
        All of this has lead to my mind being refocused on pushing design to the next level, always looking for ways to make it a little bit better than great.

        Taking something relatively normal and adding an obscure twist to the design was the unique task this project allowed me to pursue. I chose the trombone as well as the trumpet, mainly because of the unique shapes that these instruments are composed of. The general style was to use negative space to help define the shape of the structure. After the general shape was defined, I had to experiment with how to make it absurd. This is where I thought of extending the windiness of the structure to an insane level would be quite absurd indeed.

        Incorporating the family was the key object of this project, so I figured I would choose animals as the symbol to represent each of them. I chose to ask each of the family members what animal they would like to be represented by. At this point in my graphic design, I was really enjoying using a type of strokes to outline the features of the animals. The next choose was colour, which I also asked the family about initially. However, one of the members asked for black, a colour that would not work for the design so I had to consult him about a different colour.

        The Art & design community can be at times neglected, so as a part of this we were tasked with bringing awareness to this issue in the community. I chose the route of how boring things are when art and design are ignored.

        Every year the third-year students get the opportunity to have a poster they design to be used for recruiting new students to the program. I personally have always felt like a bit of a weirdo prior to joining the art and design, so I wanted to use that idea of feeling at home in the program as my main drawing point.

        For the up and coming metal band "Pythonic" I was contacted to redesign their logo. They wanted to take inspiration from the timeless logo of the band "Pantera" which incorperates a heavy and bold typeface that is clearly legible, as well as symmetry.
        
        With these elements in mind I got to work, I also wanted to incorperate elements of the Python snake as Pythonic means "of, realting to, or resembling a python". I chose to create all the letters incorperating edges to symbolize the bite of the snake.
        
        The "C" inparticular representing the jaw of the snake about to bite, and the "O" loosly representing the eye of the snake. All letters were also designed usuing the golden ratio to create a visually appealing design.

        This project incorperated coming up with a brand identity and develope a logo to encapsulate the identity of the brand.

        I chose to develope a brand revolving around custom 3D & Sculptural works, "Oddball" was what I came up with a brand that would create and build things that were outside modern design.

        I wanted the logo to mainly incorperate the loose illustration of a smiling robotic face that would be the standalone maskot for simpler marketing or used in  a variety of different ways.
